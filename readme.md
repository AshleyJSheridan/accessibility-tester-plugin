# Site Accessibility Tester Add-on for Firefox

This is a work-in-progress add-on for Firefox to serve as an aid to developers ensuring their web content is accessible.

While it's in the initial stages of development, it will only be available as a Temporary Add-on.

## Installation

* Check out the repository locally
* Navigate to the root directory of the project
* Run `sass --update popup/scss:popup/css` to generate the styles for the add-on menu
* Open Firefox and point to `about:debug` in the address bar
* Click on the `Load Temporary Add-on...` button and navigate to the project directory and load the `manifest.json` file there

## Using the Add-on
